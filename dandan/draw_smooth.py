"""draw.py with smoother arm motion. Same options as draw.py; draw.py itself is untouched.

Why draw.py looks jerky
-----------------------
draw.follow() moves the pen along each stroke at one constant speed. So the speed
jumps from 0 to full at the start of a stroke and back to 0 at the end, the arm
turns sharp corners at full speed, and a detected "jump" halves the speed at once
and pauses for 0.3 s. On top of that, draw.Paper blends the taught grid points
bilinearly per cell, so joint velocities have a kink wherever the pen crosses from
one grid cell into the next. Each of these is a sudden change in joint speed,
which the servos turn into a visible jolt.

The idea: smoothstep
--------------------
smoothstep(t) = 10t^3 - 15t^4 + 6t^5 (the same curve as backend/scripts/line3.py)
goes from 0 to 1 with zero speed AND zero acceleration at both ends. Here it shapes
the pen SPEED along a stroke: every place where the speed has to drop (stroke start,
stroke end, a corner, a grid crossing) gets a smoothstep dip instead of a step, so
the arm never has to change speed abruptly. The path itself is unchanged: the pen
traces exactly the same points as draw.py, only the timing along them differs.

What changes while drawing a stroke:
- The pen speeds up and slows down with a smoothstep curve at the start and end of
  every stroke, instead of jumping straight to full speed.
- It slows down before sharp corners (square, letters, houses) and speeds up after.
- It eases off a little where the pen crosses from one taught grid cell to the next:
  the joint blend has a kink there (draw.Paper is bilinear per cell).
- When a jump is detected the speed still drops, but it eases down and back up
  instead of halving instantly and pausing for 0.3 s.
- Pen-up travel and pen-down/up use the same smoothstep ease (zero speed AND zero
  acceleration at both ends) instead of a cosine ease.

How it plugs in
---------------
draw.draw() calls follow() and glide() through the draw module, so at the bottom of
this file those two names are swapped for the smooth versions and then draw.main()
runs as usual. The swap only happens in a process started with this script; running
draw.py directly, or importing draw elsewhere, still gets the original behaviour.

Tuning
------
The constants below are all in paper-widths (the taught area is 1 wide). Bigger
RAMP / CORNER_RADIUS = gentler but slower; smaller = snappier. In a simulated run
(fake arm, 0.8 size, speed 0.15) peak joint acceleration dropped by roughly 50-65%
on square, star and starry_night, at the cost of 14-66% more drawing time. If it is
too slow, lower RAMP first; raising --speed also works, but acceleration grows with
the square of the speed, so go up in small steps.

Try it in this order:
    .venv/bin/python .../draw_smooth.py --shape starry_night --dry-run
    .venv/bin/python .../draw_smooth.py --shape starry_night --air
    .venv/bin/python .../draw_smooth.py --shape starry_night
The original is still there to compare: draw.py takes the same options.
